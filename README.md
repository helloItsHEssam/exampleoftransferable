# Example of Transferable

## Introduction

This repository includes an example of using Swift's `Transferable` protocol for seamless data transfer between apps. The implementation supports various transfer mechanisms like copy/paste, drag and drop, and ShareSheet. Based on the insights from this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/helloItsHEssam/6677ba797e8c2134398de3d8456c0e66), the project demonstrates how to design data models for efficient and secure system-level data sharing in iOS applications.
